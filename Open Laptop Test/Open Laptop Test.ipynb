    "# LionBase Open Laptop Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the LionBase Open Laptop Test! You will have 8 hours to complete this test. Once submitted, the Exec Team will schedule a time for you to present your deliverable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This test is open-ended, however we want you to approach this as though you are doing this for a real client. If your work and presentation is exemplary, you will have the opportunity to interview for a spot in the LionBase Freelancer Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask questions for clarification, however you cannot ask for a video call or for help on the code. Otherwise, the test is completely open! You are encouraged to use all the resources you have available to you -- the LionBase Education Modules, Google, etc.\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "MedX has developed a new drug that can help treat cancer. However, they can only produce the drug at a limited rate. They would like you to develop a <span style=\"color:red\">**linear regression model**</span> that can predict the death rate from cancer in a given U.S. county to help them prioritize distribution. The people you are interfacing with are not technical.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each row represents a different county in the United States.\n",
